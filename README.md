# Project

## Introduction


### Dynamic Memory Pool
 - A dynamic memory pool

### Multi-thread Algorithm
 - Research multi-thread algorithms: Dekker's and Peterson's algorithms
 - Compare those two algorithms with pthread lock.

### Object Oriented Programming Linked List
 - Use object oriented concepts to implement a linked list.
 - Extended from the linked list to a queue.
 - Extended from the linked list to a thread-safe queue.

### Performace Analysis
 - array summation
 - branchless condition
 - jump talbe
 - unit stride

### Simple Memory Allocator
 - An implementation of malloc() with linux system call: brk() and sbrk().
